Hi there, I’m Huyen!

I’m excited to start my new position at Harvard Medical School as a postdoc! I did my Ph.D. in computer science,
focusing on visualization research, where I find the meaning in
visual
representation helping bring data insight to life. My dissertation focused on interactive visualization and event
detection in time-series data.

When I'm not visualizing stuff, I like [writing](https://huyendoesstuff.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and walking. I
also like playing the
ukulele and guitar,
and their lovely “mixture” which is the baritone ukulele; although practicing these strings hurt my fingers so bad, the
delightful sound is worth the pain somehow. My ukulele tunes can be found somewhere on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/huyendoesstuff){:target="_blank"}.

...or as I often say, in Vietnamese:

Chào các bạn, tớ là Huyền!
