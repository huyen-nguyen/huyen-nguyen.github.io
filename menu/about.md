Hi there, I’m Huyen!

I'm a computer science doctoral candidate doing research in visualization, where I find the meaning in visual
representation helping bring data insight to life.

I like [writing](https://huyendoesstuff.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and walking. I also like playing the ukulele and guitar,
and their lovely “mixture” which is the baritone ukulele; although practicing these strings hurt my fingers so bad, the
delightful sound is worth the pain somehow. My ukulele tunes can be found somewhere on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/huyendoesstuff){:target="_blank"}.

...or as I often say, in Vietnamese:

Chào các bạn, tớ là Huyền!
