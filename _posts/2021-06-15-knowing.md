You know, the feeling of knowing what you want, holding that notion so close to your heart, and you search for
it, having a maybe-not-so-clear image of how it would look like, but you know for sure that you would know it when you see it?

Well. That happened to me quite often recently, *surprisingly*. Whether it is an invaluable [survey paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6400485) on a topic that has haunted
you for days, a [jekyll theme](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) (thanks, Paul!), or a [font](https://fonts.google
.com/specimen/Mulish?query=mulish), there is something so powerful, so fulfilled when you find that one thing your
heart longs for.

It just clicks :)

I hope you will find what you are looking for.
