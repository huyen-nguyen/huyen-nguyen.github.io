<i>Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a 1886 Gothic novella by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson.</i>

Writing the title still gives me chills.

➜ So, in short, don't be Mr. Hyde.

At first, Dr. Jekyll only wants to turn into Mr. Hyde for... fun, so that he isn't bound by morals and age. He has
freedom. Youth. Strength. Then at some point, he transformed into Hyde in his sleep. That– he had no control over.
That means you "switch" to your bad side without knowing it. That's very dangerous.

At one point, in his final letter, he told Mr. Utterson that the desire to live in Hyde is very strong, which is something he found to be (I don't remember the exact words) somewhat endearing/tolerable/admirable. Of course, the bad side wants to take control, never wants to leave, and wants to grow stronger over time.

Towards the end of Jekyll's life, he had to double the dose, sometimes more than double, to revert to his normal form.

It's harder and harder to come back when you're knee-deep in the dark side.
