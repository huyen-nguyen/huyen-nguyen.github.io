I find myself keeping this quote on repeat in my head recently. These heartfelt words are from the series Fleabag, in a scene where Fleabag’s dad tells her how he truly sees her for the vulnerable soul that she is.

I’m learning to love.

It’s actually harder to put my love out there than I thought.

The first time I thought about this topic of learning to love was the one time I was on a bus home. Everything felt calm and peaceful to me, making me think of how easy it was to love my life at that moment.
This sunny city, this bus ride home, Victoria, the bus driver who gave me the warmest greeting every time she saw me: everything felt easy to love.

But how about these inevitable bad days?

The love we have towards our life is that fragile and that precious. When the negative emotions all around us creep in, in the forms of loneliness, sadness, grief, or discouragement,
it’s hard, very hard, to look at the world with our beautiful, loving eyes.
It even feels like the end sometimes, when the whole world seems to be nothing but against you, and sometimes the possibilities that tomorrow days might bring don’t seem so obvious.

On these bad days, that love feels like a lie. It’s painful. *Do I love this life or not?*

At the same time, I feel like I take things for granted sometimes. The joy I feel when I’m on the bus home. The comfortable feeling when things flow easily. Now I want to document them all.
Or put them in a chest where I can come find them when I need a safe space. Ah, these conflicting confrontations
between these sweet memories and the cruel reality.

I don’t have it figured out at all. I’m quite a mess, actually. I feel lonely quite often. *When you’re 26 in 2
weeks, you’d think you have better ways to cope with loneliness, but it turns out you don’t.*

**So here I am, learning to love, to embrace my life as it is.**

“Our lovability doesn't fix loneliness.”

The only way to get through it is to get through it. But we have our love to warm us, to keep us company in the
darkest times.

This love can be manifested by reaching out to a friend or a loved one, asking them how their day was.
You may desperately want to share with them how your day went. Sometimes, they may not respond the way you want or even give you some unsolicited advice that couldn't be further from practical and more stress-inducing (which feels
terrible, believe me). After some practice, you will know what you would expect in their responses.
Just focus on the action that you want to connect with them. Some other times, these connections will lead to something wonderful :)
