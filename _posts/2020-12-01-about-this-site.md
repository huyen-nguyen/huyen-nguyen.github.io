## intro
Hi! This post is dedicated to the design decisions and inpirations I got for the process of building this site. It is
 quite a process [indeed] considering I like to 1) write blog, 2) have my own website with abundance of 
 customization, 3) combine personal site and blogging and 4) most importantly, try to design an ultimate 
 website where I really like what I see. The simple html does not allow me to do so systematically and 
 wordpress/blogger/medium allow so little customization. 
 
 So here it goes: I learn grid layout, jekyll, liquid and so many little things on the way. Voil√†!
 
## inspirations

The design for this site is based on various inspirations, including:

- <https://www.domoritz.de/>

- <http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/>

- <http://www.sehilyi.com/>

## tech

I mean... I have browsed countless themes/templates. Finally I landed on this one: 
[@al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). Thanks to [@alshedivat](https://github.com/alshedivat) for the 
incredible theme and the active community.
