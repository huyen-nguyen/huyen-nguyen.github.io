<!---Ph.D. Student in Computer Science â€¢ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ttu.edu/">Texas Tech</a>--->

Hi! I'm a Computer Science PhD student at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tommy 
Dang](http://www.myweb.ttu.edu/tnhondan/).

  My research interests include interactive visualization, visual analytics and human-computer interaction (HCI), 
  supporting the
  understanding and insight discovery of data. In 
  [interactive Data Visualization Lab (iDVL)](https://idatavisualizationlab.github.io/), I develop web-based interactive
  visualization with [D3.js]((https://d3js.org/)) and I study to construct a template
  for event  detection mechanisms in time-series data. Details are in my <a href="cv/HuyenNguyen-CV.pdf">CV</a>. 
  
<!---Before pursuing the PhD program, I received a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at [Hanoi University of 
Science
   and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/) in 2018. I worked with Dr. [Oanh Nguyen](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/can-bo/ts-nguyen-thi-oanh.html)
    in the Knowledge and Data Engineering Lab on object detection and object proposal generation.)

In 2018, I received my B.S. in Information Systems from <a href="https://en.hust.edu.vn/">Hanoi University of Science
 and Technology</a>, where I started with computer vision problems in object detection and object proposal 
 generation.
