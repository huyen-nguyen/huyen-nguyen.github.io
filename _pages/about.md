Hi! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/), doing 
research in interactive data visualization and visual analytics. I'm a member of the  [interactive Data Visualization Lab (iDVL)](https://idatavisualizationlab.github.io/), where I work with [Prof.
  Tommy Dang](http://www.myweb.ttu.edu/tnhondan/).


  My research interests include **interactive data
  visualization**, **visual analytics** and **human-computer interaction** (HCI), supporting the
  understanding and insight discovery of quantitative and qualitative data. I build web-based interactive
  visualization with [D3.js]((https://d3js.org/)) and I study to construct a template
  for event  detection mechanisms in time-series data.
  
<!---Before pursuing the PhD program, I received a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at [Hanoi University of 
Science
   and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/) in 2018. I worked with Dr. [Oanh Nguyen](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/can-bo/ts-nguyen-thi-oanh.html)
    in the Knowledge and Data Engineering Lab on object detection and object proposal generation.)

Besides my professional activities, I play the ukulele, love walking and hiking in beautiful places. I 
trekked Mount Fansipan, Vietnam's highest mountain (3,143 m / 10,312 ft) ⛰️ in 2018.
