I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Texas Tech University, doing research in interactive data visualization and 
visual analytics. I'm a member of the interactive Data Visualization Lab (iDVL).

My research interests include interactive data visualization and visual analytics, supporting the understanding and insight discovery of quantitative and qualitative data. I'm learning to build a template for event detection mechanisms in visualizing time-series data.
